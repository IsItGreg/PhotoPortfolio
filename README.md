# PhotoPortfolio

This small project is meant to be a simple way for me to display some of my favorite photos that I have taken over the last few years.

I never really had a good way to show people when they asked so I figured I should make a little digital photobook.

This was built with React and was a fun way to practice some design skills while building something that I could actually use.
