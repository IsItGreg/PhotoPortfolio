        <div>
          I've been taking photos for a few years and I finally decided I needed
          to show them somehow. Here are some of my favorites from the last few
          years.
        </div>
        <div>
          If for whatever reason you want to use a photo, feel free to send me
          an email at{" "}
          <a
            href="mailto:photo@gsme.dev"
